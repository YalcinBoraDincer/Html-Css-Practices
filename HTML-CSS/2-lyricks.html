    <pre>
        
    My lover's got humour
    She's the giggle at a funeral
    Knows everybody's disapproval
    I should've worshipped her sooner

    If the heavens ever did speak
    She is the last true mouthpiece
    Every Sunday's getting more bleak
    A fresh poison each week

    We were born sick
    You heard them say it

    My church offers no absolutions
    She tells me: Worship in the bedroom
    The only heaven I'll be sent to
    Is when I'm alone with you

    I was born sick, but I love it
    Command me to be well
    Ah, amen, amen, amen

    Take me to church
    I'll worship like a dog
    At the shrine of your lies
    I'll tell you my sins
    So you can sharpen your knife
    Offer me that deathless death
    Good God, let me give you my life

    Take me to church
    I'll worship like a dog
    At the shrine of your lies
    I'll tell you my sins
    So you can sharpen your knife
    Offer me that deathless death
    Good God, let me give you my life

    If I'm a pagan of the good times
    My lover is the sunlight
    To keep the goddess on my side
    She demands a sacrifice
    Drain the whole sea, get something shiny

    Something meaty for the main course
    That's a fine looking high horse
    What you got in the stable?
    We've a lot of starving faithful
    That looks tasty, that looks plenty
    This is hungry work

    Take me to church
    I'll worship like a dog
    At the shrine of your lies
    I'll tell you my sins
    So you can sharpen your knife
    Offer me my deathless death
    Good God, let me give you my life

    Take me to church
    I'll worship like a dog
    At the shrine of your lies
    I'll tell you my sins
    So you can sharpen your knife
    Offer me my deathless death
    Good God, let me give you my life

    No masters or kings
    When the ritual begins
    There is no sweeter innocence
    Than our gentle sin

    In the madness and soil
    Of that sad earthly scene
    Only then I am human
    Only then I am clean, oh, oh
    Amen, amen, amen

    Take me to church
    I'll worship like a dog
    At the shrine of your lies
    I'll tell you my sins
    So you can sharpen your knife
    Offer me that deathless death
    Good God, let me give you my life

    Take me to church
    I'll worship like a dog
    At the shrine of your lies
    I'll tell you my sins
    So you can sharpen your knife
    Offer me that deathless death
    Good God, let me give you my life
